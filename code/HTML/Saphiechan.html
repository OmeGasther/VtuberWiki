        <p>Do you guys think Earth is the only place that exists in your universe. Well you couldn’t be more wrong. The
            stories of folktales told by different cultures, about Gods and Different Creatures from an unknown sources.
            Have you ever thought about where they could’ve come from?
            <br>
            <br>
            Wolf spirit guides symbolises power, showing
            great loyalty and the ability to survive the wild. These stories stem from many years ago, where known wolf
            spirits were first documented into human history, known to guide humans and shape their personalities. This
            begs the question, though, where could these supernatural stories come from?There is a world and order
            existing in an entirely different universe, completely unknown to humans. This world’s existence birthed the
            idea of gods, devils, spirits, and a multitude other supernatural beings. A small, isolated civilisation
            within this world was cut off from the rest of the world, and remained hidden within their own massive
            floating island; a civilisation called Ulversta. Ulversta was known as the Golden City, its power and
            technology reached far beyond its peoples' intelligence. The people within this city are said to be almost
            human, bearing animalistic traits and that they have bonded with their spirit animals, completely changing
            the laws of nature as we know them. Each with their own personalities and abilities, they thrived and never
            sought out communication with other civilisations. Abilities are supernatural capabilities which develop
            over time; the origins of these abilities are said to be unknown outside of one source: The Divine Gems. The
            Divine Gems are said to grow in grand quantities within caves running beneath Ulversta, giving the city and
            its occupants what many describe as an almost magical feeling. Initially, the various animal spirit
            communities had frequent rivalries with some even going as far as to be at constant war with each other. But
            there was one man, bound with a wolf spirit, who seemed to have discovered the secrets behind the crystals'
            true powers; therefore gaining the ability of immortality as a result, he used this power to seize control
            of the city and, for a time, bring a level of order to it, resulting in less conflict between the various
            communities. Over time, His bloodline grew to that of a strong royal family. Each of His descendants had
            incredible abilities such as time travel or mind control, with each descendant becoming more powerful than
            those before them and some were even rumoured to have more than one ability.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sapphire is one of the aforementioned descendants, and may be the very last of Her bloodline to ever walk in
            that world. She
            inherited the ability to control the elements; however, control was difficult and so she had to wear a
            bracelet in order to help her maintain better control over her ability. Elemental control wasn't her only
            ability, however. Unbeknownst to her, she, as well as those before her, had the ability to leech others'
            abilities and use them for her own gain or pass them onto others, entrusting them with the responsibility
            that comes with having these abilities. As the years passed, Sapphire began to grow more perceptive of the
            toxic nature poisoning the society within and around the city, and decided she could tolerate it no longer.
            She sought out a group that called themselves "The Rebellion," rumoured to be one of, if not the most
            powerful mafia consisting of both citizens and non-citizens alike. Citizen of Ulversta or not made no
            difference to this group as they all held the same mindset and had one thing in common: a wish to simply
            return to their homes. > Over time, the other members of the Rebellion became like family to her, moreso
            than her father and his deceitful wife, her "step-mother," not that she'd ever consider this woman as such.
            Years of frequent battle and seemingly perilous struggle all in the name of a single goal followed. There
            were highs, lows; times when it felt like great strides of progress were made, then others where it felt
            like their progress had gone backward. Constant trial and error with no idea of what would work and when.
            Eventually, however, it all paid off when they were able to breach the barriers protecting Ulversta, where
            they were able to gain freedom via escape to the outside world; however they didn't escape without
            discovering something major: the horrible secrets behind the Divine Stones.
            <br>
            <br>
            With their goals achieved, the Rebellion failed to see any reason to remain together, and so everyone
            eventually went their own separate
            ways, most returning to their own land and homes. Those not from this land followed some of those who were,
            hoping to find someplace to permanently post up, a new place to call home. Sapphire chose to stick to
            exploration for awhile, never tying herself to one place for too long but also never failing to make plenty
            of friends everywhere she went; however, unfortunately for her, luck never seemed to be on her side and her
            "Step-mother" was hot on her trail. Afraid Sapphire would expose not just her but the dark secrets behind
            her city's entire foundation, causing chaos to erupt and bringing a swift end to her reign and possibly her
            life. Knowing she had to do something, she used her ability to create portals to a multitude of dimensions
            to send Sapphire tumbling into a dark abyss and a new unknown land.
            <br>
            <br>
            Having been trapped on this new unknown land, what we know as our Earth, with no way to return in the
            foreseeable future, she slowly began to adapt
            to her new environment; starting with hiding her ears and tail, she hid from the humans for awhile, watching
            and observing to learn as many of their traditions, habits and various cultures.
            Following several centuries of observation, she eventually learned she could separate her physical and
            spiritual forms from one another at the cost of her ears and tail, though also allowing her to look more
            human and fit in better. Her spirit bared resemblance to a wolf, covered with fur whiter than snow and being
            ghost-like, nearly entirely transparent, and radiating a faint purple hue visible only to her eyes. Thanks
            in no small part to her newfound appearance, she was able to take up refuge with some friends she'd made and
            even found others whom shared the same fate as Sapphire at the hands of her "Step-mother.
            <br>
            <br>
            "With her new found friends and family Sapphire, she decided to start a career in streaming and being an
            online idol, showcasing
